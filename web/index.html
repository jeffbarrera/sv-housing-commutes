<h1 class="article__title">In search of cheaper housing, <br />Silicon Valley workers face long commutes</h1>

<p>As rents skyrocket across Silicon Valley, a growing number of workers have been priced out of job centers like Mountain View and Palo Alto.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, places with cheaper rents and lower median incomes have grown faster than the more affluent areas of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties.</p>

<p>Yet this shift away from expensive tech hubs comes at the cost of longer commutes, as workers have to drive further to get to their jobs.</p>

<h2>Rising Rents</h2>

<p>The booming tech economy has drawn more workers to Silicon Valley, but housing construction hasn’t kept pace. Between 2010 and 2014, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties gained around XXXXXXX new jobs, but only added XXXX additional housing units.</p>

<p>This imbalance between jobs and housing is even worse at the local level. The region’s jobs tend to be clustered in affluent cities like Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Santa Clara, while what new housing has been built in mostly located WHERE - CHECK DATA.</p>

<p>With the demand for housing near jobs vastly outstripping supply, rents have skyrocketed in cities with major tech presences. OR JUST ACROSS THE PENINSULA - CHECK DATA</p>

<h2>Moving Away</h2>

<p>Priced out of these expensive mid-Peninsula cities, Silicon Valley workers have been moving to places with more affordable living costs. Between 2010 and 2014, the population grew faster in areas with lower median rents and household incomes:</p>

<p>Down at the south end of Santa Clara county, for example, Gilroy — where the median household income in 2014 was $81,000 [CHECK] — grew from ___ people in 2010 to _____ in 2014. In Menlo Park, where the average household made $115,650, the population actually dropped by ____.</p>

<h2>Long Commutes</h2>

<p>Yet lower rents come at the price of longer commutes, since workers who live in more affordable outlying areas have to travel further to get to their jobs. The average commute time for people who work in Silicon Valley has risen from __ in 2010 to __ in 2014, and the proportion of workers who travel an hour or more to get to work has jumped?? __ FINISH.</p>

<p>These increases are driven by workers commuting into high-income, high-rent job centers like Mountain View and Palo Alto, which have some of the longest inbound travel times in Silicon Valley.</p>
